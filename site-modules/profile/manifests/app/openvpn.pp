# @summary openvpn ttunnel
#
# In order from least trusted to most trusted, the predefined zones within firewalld are:
#
# * drop:
#   The lowest level of trust. All incoming connections are dropped
#   without reply and only outgoing connections are possible.
# * block:
#   Similar to the above, but instead of simply dropping connections,
#   incoming requests are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited or
#   icmp6-adm-prohibited message.
# * public:
#   Represents public, untrusted networks. You donâ€™t trust other
#   computers but may allow selected incoming connections on a
#   case-by-case basis.
# * external:
#   External networks in the event that you are using the firewall as
#   your gateway. It is configured for NAT masquerading so that your
#   internal network remains private but reachable.
# * internal:
#   The other side of the external zone, used for the internal portion of
#   a gateway. The computers are fairly trustworthy and some additional
#   services are available.
# * dmz:
#   Used for computers located in a DMZ (isolated computers that will
#   not have access to the rest of your network). Only certain incoming
#   connections are allowed.
# * work:
#   Used for work machines. Trust most of the computers in the network.
#   A few more services might be allowed.
# * home:
#   A home environment. It generally implies that you trust most of the
#   other computers and that a few more services will be accepted.
# * trusted:
#   Trust all of the machines in the network. The most open of the
#   available options and should be used sparingly.
